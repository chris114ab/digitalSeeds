# Digital Seeds
Digital seeds is a concept business that I created in high school, as I developed my skills in html, css and javaScript.
The site is a demonstration of the skills I taught myself as a part of the Queens badge award in the boys brigade.

It also contains a concept website I made for a local cafe.

The cafe site was created towards the end of 2017 
and the Digital Seeds site was designed and coded the following year (2018).
