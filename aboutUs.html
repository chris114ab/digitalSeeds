		<p>Digital seeds is a small home run business and we are driven to help you
			launch your very own company website. Whether you have no idea what website 
			is and dont know where to start, or you have a specific vision in mind, we can
			offer a tailored experience for you elevating your company website from 
			drawings on a page to a fully functional customer experience.
		</p>
		<p> The development process would start with an old fashioned conversation
			where we try to understand your vision for the company,
			from which we make the <b>Initial Drawings</b>. These drawings are the base
			to which we add color, images, animation and most importantly content.
			We use these drawings to structure the final product to your needs.
			After the coding stage is over the website is ready to be published.
